## How it was made
The game is structured around four main files:
- `paddle.py`: Defines the Paddle class responsible for drawing the paddles and their movements.
- `ball.py`: Defines the Ball class responsible for drawing the ball and its movement logic.
- `game.py`: Implements the main game logic, including scoring, game state transitions, and interactions between the ball and the paddles.
- `main.py`: The entry point of the application. It initializes and runs the game.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pygame==2.0.1
```
3. Clone the repository or download the game files.

## Running the Game
Navigate to the directory containing the game files and run the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

The game window should open, and you can start playing!
